I tagged a commit (1936b65) (edit_v1)

Don't know how to list the tags.
Does not show in GitHub.
Changed to the "detached HEAD" with:
$git checkout edit_v1

Now i branched from that tag to add
this file. (some_taginfo) branch.

[2022-10-14] Will do some tests with manually editing tags...
Adding a textfile "spunk" in .git/refs/tags/ pointing to b38dba5226f811fb6cf123cea1a11f9635ff923b
--Works fine
Editing textfile. Moving tag to 660892bfe7fe4aa9e8c9eed443ecdefd7c1ce265
--Works fine. No questions asked.
Question about behaviour of Git-server when pushing an existing tag.
