Yay!
testing github repos.

Initial, just playing around.

This is 1stbranch! ###Not anymore, merged and deleted to master###
Did a rebase of 1stbranch from master.
Then pull.
-Strange things happened to the git tree view.

Just did a signed Tag in branch "edit_branch" on commit 1936b65
This is master. (protected?)
$ git tag -s -m "Tag along" edit_v1 1936b65



Who can see this?
Who can commit?

Merged 1stbranch to master and deleted the branch.
Do we got history?
This is still a working branch. Some suff is missing from master.x
Efter den här incheckningen så tänker jag tagga #1936b65

Where is my Tag showing?
Local git log but not in GitHub

$git tag                #lists the tag. lightweight?
$git tag -v edit_v1     #checks the tag. Verifies GPG sign.
